# Guessing Game

This is a simple "Guessing Game" I created while learning Rust from *The Rust Programming Language* book. It is a console-based game where the computer generates a random number, and the player has to guess it.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding basic Rust syntax
- Working with loops, conditions, and random number generation
- Practicing error handling and user input/output in Rust

## Features

- Generates a random number between 1 and 100
- Prompts the user to guess the number
- Gives feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct
- Tracks the number of attempts

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>

2. Navigate to the project folder and run the game using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo run


## Learning Resources
This project is based on the tutorial from the official Rust book. You can follow along with the Guessing Game tutorial.
